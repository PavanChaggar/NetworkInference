# Network Inference
This repository houses progress toward creating a flexible inference framework for network brain modelling of protein propagation. 

The current goals are to implement: 

- [x] Simulations of protein propagation on brain networks using network diffusion models and Fisher-Kolmogorov–Petrovsky–Piskunov (FKPP) models. 
- [ ] Perform inference using sampling methods such as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), variational inference and simulation based inference. 
- [ ] Compare the efficacy and efficiency of these algorithms with variably sized free parameter sets and network sizes. 

Work in progress documentation can be found [here](https://pavanchaggar.github.io/NetworkInference/intro.html).
